# WebRTCUtils

WebRTCUtils is a browser library that can be used to simplify creation and handling of RTCPeerConnection objects, to control the browserâ€™s WebRTC API.

Fork from https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-utils-js, and the original library is not actively maintained. So creating this repository.
